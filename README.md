# paranjay-gulati-website

Personal single-page site built with plain HTML and Tailwind via CDN.

## Local preview

Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double‑click the file or drag it into a tab) to view the page.

## Deploying to Vercel

The repo is now a static site. When pushed to GitHub, Vercel serves `index.html` from the project root.  
`vercel.json` ensures every route rewrites to that file so you won't see 404s on deep links.
